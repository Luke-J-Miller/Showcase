# GAN for Identification of Real vs Faked Images from the Oxford Flower Dataset
This repository contains our work in implementing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to distinguish between real and faked images from the Oxford Flower Dataset.

The project demonstrates the power of GANs in generating realistic images and their potential use cases in detecting faked images. This serves as a foundation for future sophisticated models and fine-tuning.

## Overview
We have implemented a GAN that consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new flower images from random points in the latent space, and the discriminator is trained to classify whether an image is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).

The project encompasses:

- Downloading and preprocessing the Oxford Flower dataset.
- Building and training a GAN model, which includes a generator and a discriminator.
- Training the GAN and monitoring the training loss.
- Loading the trained generator and creating new flower images.
- Visualizing the generated images.
## Results
After training our GAN, we obtained a generator capable of creating realistic flower images and a discriminator able to distinguish between real and fake images.

## Future Work
Possible avenues for exploration include:

Refining the GAN model by adding more layers or changing the architecture.
Tuning the hyperparameters of the GAN for better performance.
Training the GAN on different datasets to test its versatility.
Incorporating other types of GANs such as DCGAN, CycleGAN, etc.
Improving the robustness of our model's evaluation.
Implementing more robust error handling and testing.
